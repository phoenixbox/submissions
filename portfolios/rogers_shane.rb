      :description => "Socrada's aim is to enable a user to visualize their social connections and then strategize their networking based on this information. Challenging aspects overcome in this project included the substitution of a traditional ActiveRecord based relational database to using a node based graph database called Neo4j. As well as this I learned Cypher the query language for Neo4j, implemented the VivaGraph JS graphing library to visualize the node relationships and constructed trenched background workers that mitigate Twitter rate limiting issues."

I was the design lead on this project and led the implementation of a jQuery Masonry based user feed, which beautifully laid out all the users Tuneline feed content. From a technical standpoint, we leveraged hstore and single table inheritance to easily create the relationship between a user and their many feed items."

As part of this 4 person team, we were quite proud of our TDD process and maintained excellent test quality and coverage throughout the build. I am most proud of my implementation of the admin statistics dashboard which used Morris.js and the Raphael JS graphing library to visualize admin sales statistics."
